Arduino sketch that uses an SD card module and a keypad to simulate keyboard input based on script files. The script files are stored on the SD card, and when a key is pressed, the corresponding script is read from the SD card and executed by simulating keyboard input.

SD Card Initialization:
Make sure that the SD card is properly formatted and contains the script files with the specified naming convention ("script1_txt", "script2_ps1", etc.).
Check the wiring of the SD card module to ensure proper connections.

Keyboard Simulation:
Verify that the keyboard emulation part is working as expected.
Ensure that the delay between key presses is appropriate for your use case.

Keypad Wiring:
Double-check the wiring of the keypad. Ensure that each row and column pin is connected correctly.

Serial Output:
Use the Serial monitor to debug and check if the program is running as expected. Serial.print and Serial.println statements are already in the code for this purpose

Script File Format:
Ensure that the script files on the SD card are in the correct format and contain the expected content.

Script Numbering:
Verify that the script numbering and mapping to keys are correct.

Power Supply:
Make sure your Arduino and peripherals are powered appropriately. Unstable power can lead to erratic behavior.

Library Versions:
Ensure that you are using compatible versions of the libraries (SdFat, Keypad, Keyboard).

Error Handling:
Implement additional error handling, especially in the SD card and file operations, to provide more information in case of failures.

Testing:
Test each component individually if possible. Ensure that the keypad, SD card module, and keyboard emulation are working as expected.
By addressing these points, you can troubleshoot and ensure that your Arduino sketch functions as intended. If you encounter specific issues or error messages, feel free to provide more details for further assistance.
